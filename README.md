# A Study of Quality Gate Usage in SonarCloud Projects

This repository contains the data collection script and replication package for our academic paper investigating the use of software quality gates. The script is designed to systematically gather data from [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io) to identify projects that leverage quality gates and to analyze the specific rules they enforce.

## üìù Overview

This project provides the tools and data necessary to replicate the findings for RQ3 as described in our paper. The core of this repository is a Java-based application that interacts with the SonarCloud Web API to:
1.  Identify large, public software projects.
2.  Determine if these projects use SonarCloud quality gates within their CI/CD pipeline (specifically on Pull Requests).
3.  Collect the specific conditions and thresholds that define these quality gates.

## üî¨ Data Collection Methodology

The data collection process was performed in three distinct phases, as detailed below.

### Phase 1: Project Identification

The first phase focused on identifying a large set of candidate projects from SonarCloud.

1.  **Filter Projects:** We collected all public projects on SonarCloud with **more than 100,000 lines of code**. This was achieved by querying the SonarCloud API:
2.  **Gather Metadata:** For each project, we retained its organization name, project name, and project key.
3.  **Enrich with GitHub Data:** For projects linked to a GitHub repository, we used [Perceval](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval) to mine comprehensive metadata from the GitHub API. This included:
    *   Project metrics (stars, forks, license).
    *   Primary programming language.
    *   Detailed authorship information (committers, issue/PR commenters) to identify corporate contributions based on email domains.

### Phase 2: Quality Gate Usage Analysis

After identifying the projects, we analyzed their use of quality gates. Our definition of "using a quality gate" is based on its integration with the Pull Request (PR) workflow. A CI/CD pipeline that runs SonarCloud analysis against a PR acts as a quality gate, as the code can only be merged if it passes the defined quality checks.


### Phase 3: Quality Gate Rule Extraction

Finally, for projects confirmed to be using quality gates, we collected the specific rules and conditions they enforce.
